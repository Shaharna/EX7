Theoretical question:
As a client, at the first time you got a token. You have 2 options:
a. save the token locally (for example in a file or in SP)
b. use this token only in this current app-launch,
and re-request a token from the server each time the app launches again.

write at least 1 pro and 1 con for each implementation (a) & (b),
 in your git repository in a file named "theoretical_question.txt".

I've implemented option a, as i saved the token in the SP.

Pro's and Con's for a option:

Pros - easy implementation and faster then requesting from the server.

Cons - less secured as it is storage on one's phone,
less reliable as if the server changed their token format the request to the server will fail.
also less reliable as the server will not verify the user's user name each app launch.

Pro's and Con's for b option:

Pro - more reliable as if the server changed their token format the request from the server will fail,
more secured as the server can verify the user's user name every time and one can't
access the token from the phone storage.

Cons - slower data retrieval, causes an additional server request.
